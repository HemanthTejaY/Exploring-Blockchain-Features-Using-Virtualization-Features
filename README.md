# Exploring-Blockchain-Features-Using-Virtualization-Features

Blockchain technology is experiencing prosperity as it is a very powerful and revolutionary trend. A wide variety of open source
blockchains emerge recent years, which are different in architecture design or protocol parameters. When a developer wants to 
compare working of different blockchains, he could conduct a simulation with event simulator, or run application on physical 
machines. Either way will result in problems of unconvincing or costly. Container, a lightweight virtualization technique, is 
suitable for solving this dilemma. Tens of containers could run simultaneously in a single-core CPU computer,with each container
having a running blockchain client. Hence, in this project we attempt to build a private ethereum blockchain with two clients 
using containers. We also use the RPC method to enable them to communicate and also get rewards for finding blocks by mining.
